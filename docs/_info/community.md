## BonVision Community
[Forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bonsai-users): We will be using the Bonsai google forum for BonVision discussions, as some issues can be overlapping and related to the Bonsai framework rather than the specifics of BonVision.

Bonsai: [Node info](https://bonsai-rx.org//docs/observables/), [Bonsai Resources & Tutorials](https://bonsai-rx.org//resources/)

## Example Scripts
