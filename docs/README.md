# Welcome to the BonVision wiki!


### BonVision is an open-source closed-loop visual stimulus generator developed by the [Saleem Lab](www.saleemlab.com) and [Solomon Lab](www.solomonlab.info) at the [UCL Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience](http://www.ibn.ucl.ac.uk/) in collaboration with [NeuroGears](https://neurogears.org/).

### BonVision's key features include:
* Naturally closed-loop system based on reactive coding of the Bonsai framework
* Handles 2D and 3D stimuli with equal ease
* Display independent stimulus generation
* Graphical programming language of the Bonsai framework
* Can be used for Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality of 2D visual stimuli
